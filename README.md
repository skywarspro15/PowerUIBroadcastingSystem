# PowerUI Broadcasting System
A broadcasting server for PowerUI TV. Broadcast your content, and let viewers watch it.

# Setting up the system
Firstly, get yourself a web host, such as Replit. After that,
you need the Flask python package to start. Install it through

```py
pip install flask
```

After you've done that, create a new empty folder, and drag in the ``` main.py ``` file.

# Start broadcasting
To start broadcasting, drag in your video over and then name it ``` broadcast.mp4 ```.
Run the ``` main.py ``` file and you should be good to go!
